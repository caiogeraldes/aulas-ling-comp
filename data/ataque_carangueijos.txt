Apparently we have one of those biological freaks resulting from an overdose of radiation poisoning. The way to explain it is... Look. Electricity. The free electron in the copper atom breaks off to circle the next atom, taking the charge along the wire. The free electrons jump from atom to atom along the copper at the speed of light.
Well, something like that has happened to our crab. But instead of free electrons, the crab has free atoms... All disconnected. It's like a mass of liquid... with a permanent shape.
Any metal, therefore, that the crab eats will be assimilated in his body of solid energy, becoming part of the crab.
